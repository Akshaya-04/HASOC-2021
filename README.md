# HASOC-2021
Automated recognition and detection of Hate Speech and Offensive language on different Online Social Networks, mainly Twitter, presents a challenge to the community of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Unfortunately, sometimes these ideas communicated via the internet are intended to promote or incite hatred or humiliation of an individual, community, or even organizations. The HASOC shared task is to attempt to automatically detect abusive language on Twitter in English and Indo-Aryan Languages like Hindi. To participate in this task and provide our input, we (team Data Pirates) presented several machine learning models for Hindi Subtasks. The datasets provided allowed the development and testing of supervised machine learning techniques. The top 2 performing models for sub-task A were Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression with the same Macro F1 score of 0.7394. The top 2 performing models for sub-task B were Logistic Regression and CatBoost, with Macro F1 scores of 0.4828 and 0.4709, respectively. This overview intends to provide detailed understandings and to analyze the outcomes.
